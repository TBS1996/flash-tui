flashcard app in your terminal

With this I plan to make a competitive flashcard app to anki, it is currently in working order but the main features are yet to be implemented, which will be a novel way of prioritizing cards based on a neural network, and a DAG-style dependency logic connecting how the various cards relate to each other.
